      <h1>Welcome to <span class="highlight">Brooklyn Bridge</span></h1>
      <p>The Brooklyn Bridge is a cable-stayed suspension bridge in New York City, spanning the East River between the boroughs of Manhattan 
        and Brooklyn. Opened on May 24, 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was the first fixed crossing of the East River. 
        It was also the longest suspension bridge in the world at the time of its opening, with a main span of 1,595.5 feet and a deck 
        127 ft above Mean High Water. The span was originally called the New York and Brooklyn Bridge or the East River Bridge but was 
        officially renamed the Brooklyn Bridge in 1915.</p>

      <h2>About the Brooklyn Bridge</h2>
      <p>Proposals for a bridge connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn were first made in the early 19th century, 
        which eventually led to the construction of the current span, designed by John A. Roebling. 
        The project's chief engineer, his son Washington Roebling, contributed further design work, assisted by the latter's wife, 
        Emily Warren Roebling. Construction started in 1870 and was overseen by the New York Bridge Company, 
        which in turn was controlled by the Tammany Hall political machine. Numerous controversies and the novelty of the design prolonged the 
        project over thirteen years. After opening, the Brooklyn Bridge underwent several reconfigurations, having carried horse-drawn vehicles 
        and elevated railway lines until 1950. To alleviate increasing traffic flows, additional bridges and tunnels were built across the East 
        River. Following gradual deterioration, the Brooklyn Bridge was renovated several times, including in the 1950s, 1980s, and 2010s.</p>
